							<h3>Earth lollipop</h3>
							<h4>Feb 25, 2017</h4>
							<p>My first project called Earth lollipop. It sounds interesting, doesn't it? When I started shotting, I have two ideas, first thought is called cool lime, I want to shoot people,
								swimming in the Starbucks drink, but I found my ideas and my friend a heavy repeated, so I decided to shoot and produce second of my ideas, planet lollipop. At first
								I didn't choose the idea because it was too difficult. I needed to create a space background and a planet that I hadn't tried before. My friends all know that I'm a pilish 
								style person hah, and most of my pictures were black and red. It was exciting and interesting for me to try and make some fantastic pictures for the first time.

								My pictures want to convey the feelings of the girl in the picture, but this feeling is exaggerated. I think it is very interesting to show it in the form of pictures. In the firs
								t picture, we can see the girl eating a lollipop, which is an earth style lollipop. Then, in the second picture, the girl sits on the earth and watches the Milky way. The first 
								picture is real, and the second one is more like a girl's feelings. In my picture, I need to seriously consider the color and contrast, there is an important point I need to 
							pay much attention to the second picture, the picture frame and the balance of the elements, because most of the elements I need to use Photoshop to create. </p>

							<h3>SYMPHONNY Exhibition</h3>
							<h4>June 20， 2018.</h4>
							<p>Firstly, our group aims to create a free space of audio for participants to be both producer(
								sender) and listener(receiver) while they are experiencing. They will operate five exhibited
								phones with different playlists. It can be seen as an exploratory journey or an experience.
								We will guide participants to produce sound in unison as a symphony which has four
								movements from low to high pitches:</p>
								<p>
								1. an opening sonata or Allegro</p>
								<p>2. a slow movement, such as adagio</p>
								<p>3. a minute or scherzo with trio</p>
								<p>4. an allegro, rondo, or sonata</p>
								<p>Specifically, we’d like to organize our work and conduct our participants to follow these
								four stages above to produce a real symphony instead of some random sound combinations.
								For instance, we will open up to two phones with low-pitch ambient sound to be
								exhibited at the beginning.Then we will increase the number of the exhibited phone by 1
								(with higher-pitch sound) every 10 minutes until the 5th phone joins in. We will take the
								ambient sound (two phones of stage1) off when the 5th phone join in (which is the last
								movement of the symphony). One complete round will take 40 minutes. During the 40
							minutes, we are going to conduct participants to create a symphony in four movements.</p>
